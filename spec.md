# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - I built the CLI to be as easy on the eyes as possible, while still maintaining full functionality of what I wanted.  Behind the scenes some of the stuff might be a little ugly-ish when I'm using a heredoc to get the little artwork logo to display, but from the user standpoint it should be clean and easy to use. Users can type in list, a number or text to navigate through the available choices on our menu system.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - We are going out to http://store.steampowered.com and scraping the website using a mix of Selenium, PhantomJS and Nokogiri due to the complications with javascript's dynamic content on the steam's homepage.  It ended up working out because we use Selenium to get past the age gates and mature content filters to scrape the information we need. I would have issues with this normally, but since we are not displaying any images nor should we be displaying any content that really should be not safe for work it should be ok.  After scraping content from the homepage and each subsequent store page we load all of that into an array of hashes.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - The user can type in list to get a list of all of today's deals scraped from the Steam homepage.  They can also type in a number which allows them to look at any of the deals we have available and see the details of that game or program.  Our detail view shows more information then the list view does by displaying things like a release date, reviews if available and the popular tags assigned to said game by the users and steam software.
